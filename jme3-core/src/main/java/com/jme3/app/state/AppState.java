/**
 * AppState represents continuously executing code inside the main loop.
 * 
 * An <code>AppState</code> can track when it is attached to the 
 * {@link AppStateManager} or when it is detached. 
 * 
 * <code>AppState</code>s are initialized in the render thread, upon a call to 
 * {@link AppState#initialize(com.jme3.app.state.AppStateManager, com.jme3.app.Application) }
 * and are de-initialized upon a call to {@link AppState#cleanup()}. 
 * Implementations should return the correct value with a call to 
 * {@link AppState#isInitialized() } as specified above.
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>If a detached AppState is attached then <code>initialize()</code> will be called
 * on the following render pass.
 * </li>
 * <li>If an attached AppState is detached then <code>cleanup()</code> will be called
 * on the following render pass.
 * </li>
 * <li>If you attach an already-attached <code>AppState</code> then the second attach
 * is a no-op and will return false.
 * </li>
 * <li>If you both attach and detach an <code>AppState</code> within one frame then
 * neither <code>initialize()</code> or <code>cleanup()</code> will be called,
 * although if either is called both will be.
 * </li>
 * <li>If you both detach and then re-attach an <code>AppState</code> within one frame
 * then on the next update pass its <code>cleanup()</code> and <code>initialize()</code>
 * methods will be called in that order.
 * </li>
